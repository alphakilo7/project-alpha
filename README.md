# Project Alpha
Hello World!  
Welcome to my Django hobby project! This project implements many of my ideas in a single project. I have used Bootstrap for front-end development while SQLite3 as database.  

## Navigation
### Home
The home page of the project, currently empty! Feel free to add relevant content here.

### SQLite
The project-alpha page. It has register/login page. Registration and login actions will be implemented here. Also planning to create a lightweight Content Management System (CMS) using SQLite3.

### More to come...

Font family used in the project is **San Francisco Display** by ***Apple Inc***. Downloaded from **[onlinewebfonts](https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/)**.
